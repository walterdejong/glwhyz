HISTORY
Way back in 1996 in wrote the WHYz! demo in 100% assembly code for i386
on my poor old 33 MHz 486 machine.  Actually, I wrote it in C first and
made the assembly version from that. It was meant as an electronic
birthday card.
In 1997, I ported the WHYz! demo (C version) to Linux using the svgalib.
In early 2006, I was playing around with SDL and ported the WHYz! demo
to SDL.
In 2007, I reimplemented the WHYz! demo in SDL/GL. This is a full rewrite,
only the wave effect remains the same, but this was fully rewritten as
well. In 2015, I greatly revised the code, and used C++.


USAGE
There are some things you can do while it is running:
- press Pause or P to pause the demo
- press w for a wireframe model (this uncovers how it all works)
- press Return to toggle fullscreen mode
- press Escape to quit the program


RANDOM REMARKS
- This was my second program with OpenGL and took 1 day to write.

- This is the first texture mapped WHYz! demo. In the other versions, I was
  only shoving pixels around.

- There is no music, but adding music with SDL is easy.
